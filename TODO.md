1. Get the radio buttons in the 'Select Crime' drop down to look like plain buttons and fill the whole
width of the drop down.
2. Expand line graph in Graph.js in a similar manner to how I expanded the bar graph, allowing
	 setting colors per data point as opposed to per data set.

Misc
====
All of the global variables make me really uncomfortable (even though I use them extensively), so I
need to do some reading in js best practices and think more on the problem.

Adding onto this, I should modularize the code even further. For example, I need to move the 'Select
Crime' menu population sooner, as I've defined every crime type statically anyways.
